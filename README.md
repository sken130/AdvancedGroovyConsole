# Advanced Groovy Console

As titled. The aim of this project is to enhance the built-in Groovy Console provided by the greate Apache Groovy.

Enhancement list:

1. Add common UI inputs so that you don't need to update your Groovy scripts every time you want to run run your script on a different input text or input file.
2. More coming up.
